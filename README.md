# ASE [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/simo-r/ASE.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/simo-r/ASE)  [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/simo-r/ASE/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/simo-r/ASE?branch=master)
Advanced Software Engineering course repository for M.Sc ICT Solutions Architect.
This repository contains all homework assignements and lesson codes.

## Note
Do not put \__init__.py in source root folder otherwise pytest won't work.
If you do it anyway you can use python3 -m pytest instead.
Of Course, coverage percentage is low but I'll improve that(also because it tests more files than it should)
